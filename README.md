## My process
In order to center the card component I have used css flex in the body. CSS flex can be very handy when it comes to put any items vertically and horizantally center. Except from that, I have used core css knowledge to perfectly build the card component.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
In this challenge I have applied my fundamentals CSS knowledge to built the layout of card 
component. For this I have used css flexbox many times.
